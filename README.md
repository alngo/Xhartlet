This project is a pet project aimed at learning Rust, WebAssembly (Wasm), and applying Clean Architecture principles to build a trading application. The goal is to create a modular and maintainable system for simulating and executing trades while exploring the performance benefits of Rust and the portability of WebAssembly.

## Technologies Used

    Rust: The primary programming language for building the backend logic. Rust is chosen for its memory safety, performance, and concurrency features.

    WebAssembly (Wasm): Used to run Rust code in web browsers, allowing for high-performance computations directly in the browser.

    WebAssembly Bindgen: Facilitates communication between Rust and JavaScript/TypeScript, making it seamless to call Rust functions from the frontend.
